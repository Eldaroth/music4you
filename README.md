# music4you

A simple Java application I had to write to qualify for my Master in Business Information Technology. The application was the final assignment after one year of time to learn Java in self-study. Although the school provided their teaching material, I prefered to learn Java with the MOOC of the University of Helsinki ["Programming with Java I & II"](http://moocfi.github.io/courses/2013/programming-part-1/).

## Assignment
Had to create a java application for a fictional music store called "Music4You", which rented out instruments to private persons as well as clubs/associations. The user interface could either be CLI-based or GUI-based, I chose the CLI as I did not yet touch Swing or something similar.

### Requirements
The application should have a minimal data structure in form of the common CRUD-operations as well as following the object oriented principles and definitions. Function-wise the application should allow the
  - administration of the instrument catalog,
  - administration of client data and
  - administration of the rentals.
  
For this we had to use serialization in order to create persistent data and store it in a txt-file. There was no specification or lecture in the teaching material on how the structure of the application should look like, so I had to rely on a example application they did in the schools Bachelor programming class.

### Realization
This repository represents my personal solution of the assignment. I am sure there are plenty of improvements that can be made in the source code, but this is the final result I handed in. I might come back to the project and try to refine it in the future.
